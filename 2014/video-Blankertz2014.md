## Outline

This is a tutorial style presentation (1.5 hours). The outline of the tutorial is as follows:

* From the oddball paradigm to ERP-based BCI speller
* From univariate To multivariate features
* Classification of ERP features
* Understanding spatial filters

Also, the following are optional:
* The linear model
* Illustration of spatial patterns and filters
* Interpretability of spatial filters
* Issues in validation

## Overview

Mainly focuses on measurement and signal processing techniques for non-invasive BCI such as Electroencephalogram (EEG). 



Describe different types of neural oscillations and focus on Evoked Response Potential (ERP) signals.
