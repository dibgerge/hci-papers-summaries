The main objective of this article is to see if there is any evoked response potential (ERP) using EEG data when a subject is subject to auditory stimuli sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Thus, this shows the brain can understand statistical changes in the environment. 

Results show that the ERP is detected when an odd auditory frequency tone (from a predetermined Gaussian distribution of auditory tones) is played to the subject. This phenomena still occurs no matter if the subject is tasked with a simple visual detection task or a cognitive load which requires using the memory to identify visual stimuli. 

## Experiments

* There were a total of 41 adult participants in this study. Some participant data was dropped due to low quality of the EEG data. 
* EEG equipment used was the 64 channel BioSemi Active Two Ag-AgCl system. 
* Experiment trials were epoched from -100ms to 400ms in peri-stimulus time
* Data was downsampled from 1024 Hz to 200 Hz, filtering using a Butterworth filter between 0.5 and 40 Hz, and thresholded at 100 $\mu V$ for artefacts, and baseline corrected between -100 and 0 ms.
