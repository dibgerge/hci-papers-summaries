This paper is a short letter describing a particular technique showing off a mental type-writer method during a conference at Berlin-BCI. This mental typewriter is capable of typing at up to 7.6 characters per minute, which was the state of the art (in 2006). However the speed varied between subjects, and could be as slow as 2.3 char/min.

The challenge of the mental typewriter is to map a small number of BCI control states (typically two) to the high number of symbols (e..g 26 letters in English alphabet + punctuation). The typewriter presents the English alphabet within a series of hexagons, as shown below.

There is six hexagon fields surrounding a circle, with five letters in each of them. The arrow in the center of the circle is used to select one of the hexagons. The arrow is controlled using two mental states, recorded using EEG: 

* Imagined right hand movement turns the arrow clockwise
* Imagined foot movement stops the rotation and the arrow starts extending.

A hexagon is selected when the arrow touches one of the hexagon. This is a two step procedure. Where a group of letters is selected in the first part from a given hexagon. Then this group of letters is later presented each in its own hexagon for selection. 

### Comments

* This is an interesting approach for a typewriter, I wonder how things have evolved since this paper has been published. 
* Need to look up if there is any publications related to the techniques used to register the two mental states used in this demo? Do they use particular frequency bands? 
* They mention in abstract that this BCI does not operate on evoked potentials, which is interested, but no elaboration is made on the subject, and the paper only described the demo.
